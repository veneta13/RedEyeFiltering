First, you need to clone this repository. To do so, use the following command:

```


Inside the newly created folder is the project's source code.

If your IDE supports CMake you can open the project and run the provided [CMakeLists](CMakeLists.txt) file,
else you can read on how to manually set up CMake [here](https://tuannguyen68.gitbooks.io/learning-cmake-a-beginner-s-guide/content/chap1/chap1.html).

After running the CMake script, ```solution.exe``` file will be created.
